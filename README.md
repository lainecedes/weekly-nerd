# Weekly Nerd

This is my Weekly Nerd blog made for the minor Web Design and Development. 

I had the challenge of making my blog as personal as possible, so I chose my most favorite social media platform, Twitter 2.0, for my design. This blog has a collection of lectures with talented and meaningful lecturers that I've been throughout the minor. I write about these moments, and reflect below after.

## To do list
When I have time left, I want to:

- Add a favorites page where you can favorite tweets on the 'timeline', and these favorited tweets will show on that page. The favorite button works, but is not fully functional yet
- cleaning up my code
- adding this project to my portfolio.


The end result can be seen at the link in the About me section of this repo.

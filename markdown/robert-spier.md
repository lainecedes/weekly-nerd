### Type of employer
Freelancing

or continue studying or doing something completely different.

All of these have their own advantages and disadvantages


### The Stack
Favoriete programmeertalen van het persoon
You cab learn everything once you know the basics. Everything is basically the same.

Please never ask me to write React of Next
But maybe you love it, give it a chance

Most popular languages
- NodeJS
- React
- jQuery(!)
- Express
- Angular
- Vue

He basically learns new languages, frameworks and technologies every year (and pretend to know then fluently on LinkedIn).

### The Money
How much do you want to earn?

Money vs Benefits
Bruto vs Netto
Fulltime vs Parttime

So what is a good salary?
- Discuss with each other
- Use the internet / apply to job
- Calculate your monthly costs

A normal salary is what you can do, combined with how your peers are ceing evaluaied and how much your company can pay.


Benefits?
- Travel reinbursement
- Vacation money
- Pension building?
- Development budget?
- Bonus?
- Profit sharing?
- Stock options?
- Flexible budget?
- A car?

Important of this all: Balance

### The Vibe
Immaterial recognition
(yeah dude this place is awesome)!
- Leaving early on a Friday?
- Awesome colleageles and mentoring
- Fun Outings and drinks
- Very close to home
- Loads of autonomy in projects?

That being said, it is no subsitute to a fair and honest salary combined with realistic experience of a junior.

Conclusion:
- Discuss benefits with your classmates
- Do your own reseaech
- It is okay to say no to a company
- Finally: It's your job, you will go there every day. Have fun and feel recognized. That is the most important part!

The best way you learn is by doing your own projects. Tutorials will only get you so far. Go build epic shit!
It is okay to fail, it's better to build 10 average things than get stuck on a single perfect one.
Network network network! I never had a portfolio but people still find me because I meet them, reach out to them, interact with them. Soft skills are vital.

You already have no, why not ask for the yes!

### A Day in the Life of a Creative Technologist

### Engaging with the Audience
His presentation isn’t just about him, he’s keen to learn about his audience. He posed questions to us students, encouraging us to envision their future careers.

He emphasizes that CMD offers a broad foundation to achieve any of these career paths.

- In-House Services

He also acknowledges that some may choose to continue studying or pursue completely different paths.

### The Technology Stack
Robert discusses his favorite programming languages, emphasizing the importance of mastering the basics to learn new technologies quickly. While he prefers not to work with React or Next, he encouraged us to explore and find their own preferences. Popular languages and frameworks include NodeJS, React, jQuery, Express, Angular, and Vue.

### Understanding Compensation
Robert addresses the topic of salary, stressing the need to balance money with benefits. Key considerations include:

- Money vs. Benefits: Travel reimbursement, vacation money, pension, development budget, bonuses, profit sharing, stock options, flexible budgets, and a car.
- Bruto vs. Netto: Gross versus net income.
- Fulltime vs. Parttime: Different work arrangements.

He advises discussing salary expectations with peers, using the internet for research, and calculating monthly costs to determine a fair salary.

### The Importance of Workplace Culture
Beyond salary, Robert highlights the significance of workplace culture. Factors like early leave on Fridays, awesome colleagues, fun outings, proximity to home, and project autonomy contribute to job satisfaction. However, these perks should not replace fair compensation and realistic job expectations.

### Too long, didn't read + final thoughts
So the lecture concludes with key takeaways for us students:

Discuss the benefits: Engage in conversations with classmates.
Do your own research: Stay informed and proactive.
Say no when necessary: It’s okay to reject offers that don't meet your expectations.
Find joy in your job: Ensure the job aligns with your passions and makes you feel recognized.

Robert encourages students to build their own projects and learn by doing. Networking is crucial; meeting people, reaching out, and developing soft skills can open doors even without a portfolio. His parting advice: "You already have a 'no,' why not ask for a 'yes'?"

Embark on your journey with confidence, stay curious, and never stop learning. The tech world is vast and full of opportunities waiting for you to explore.

I wasn't at his lecture due to sickness, but he did give a mini lecture before, and I wrote down some useful pieces that I found very interesting.

Jeremy Keith used the Gov.uk structuring forms as an example on how to style forms and input fields.

Avoid the select elements, backed with research

What type inputs to use and ignoring the css styling

## Building blocks
Labels and Inputs
Fieldsets and legends
Textarea

Name and value important for data

You need to figure out the client side
What happens with only raw html?

Only way to trigger = details and summary
You need javascript 

If you have a pattern you need a title attribute

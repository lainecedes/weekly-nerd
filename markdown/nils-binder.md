## The wrapper element
Container for website does 3 things:
* sets max width 
* adds a little bit of padding
* centers the content (not always, most of the time)
How to build ?
* .wrapper {
    * Max-width 75rem
    * margin: 0 auto
    * Padding: 0 1.5rem }
instead: 
* .wrapper {
    * Width: min(100% - 3 rem, 75rem);
    * Margin-inline: auto }
Or even shorter: 
* .wrapper {
    *  margin-inline: max(1.5rem,((100% - 75rem) /2)); }
You can change the max width to custom property

## Why do we do this? 
Figma is better than Photoshop because Figma tools are close to writing code, introduced 6 years ago.
Pic of quote
Units that are available in Figma are px, % and rem, but mostly pixels
CSS: px, % rem, ch, ex, em
Lot of viewport based units, including container queries etc

## Exploring the Web Development Ecosystem with Jeffrey Arts
Jeffrey Arts is a versatile artist, designer, and front-end developer who also creates 3D sculptures. His multifaceted expertise allows him to navigate both the artistic and technical realms of web development.

### Web Development Ecosystem: Backend or Frontend?
Jeffrey's approach to web development is insightful. He believes that each part of the development ecosystem, whether backend or frontend, creates a specific framework for thinking. Although he does engage in backend development, he limits himself to Node.js. This allows him to reuse his skills effectively and dive deep into specific areas.

### Deployment Process
Jeffreyâ€™s deployment process is streamlined and efficient, leveraging a combination of tools and technologies:

- Git
- npm
- DotENV
- ChatGPT
- Bash

He sets up his local environment (localhost) and server with ease. For deployment, Jeffrey uses NODE (pn2) and has developed a command with yarn that allows him to deploy his site from the terminal in just two minutes. This quick and efficient process highlights his proficiency in managing both new projects and updates to existing ones.

### Toolbox Workflow
Jeffrey emphasizes the importance of having a well-developed workflow. While he acknowledges that Git is a powerful tool, he also notes its complexity when it comes to reverting changes. To address this, he has developed his own toolbox, which can be found at perceptie.jefferyarts.nl. This toolbox includes various tools and libraries that support his development process, such as the GSAP library for creating and testing effects on different browsers. He finds inspiration in how different browsers handle effects uniquely.

One of his notable creations is the glitch effect, which is part of his toolbox available at toolbox-image-effects.jefferyarts.nl.

### Devboard Toolbox
Jeffrey has also developed small applications for generating images, which can be seen at devboard.jefferyarts.nl. This platform allows users to manipulate patterns and parameters to create unique images.

### Core Technologies and Personal Workflow
Jeffrey believes in sticking to core technologies as much as possible, favoring TypeScript over JSX. This approach ensures stability and consistency in his projects. Additionally, he creates tools that support his personal workflow, such as the command yarn create Jeff-frontend, which streamlines the setup of his frontend projects.

### Too long, didn't read?
In conclusion, Jeffrey Arts exemplifies the blend of creativity and technical expertise required in modern web development. By focusing on core technologies, creating efficient workflows, and developing unique tools, he manages to take projects from localhost to the web in under five minutes. His innovative approach and dedication to both art and technology make him a standout figure in the field of web development.

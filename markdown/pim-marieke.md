## Digitaal Toegankelijk: Insights from "Weekly Nerd" on Accessibility
In a recent Weekly Nerd session focused on digital accessibility, Marieke de Hoop, a researcher and former CMD student, and Pim Schuurman, co-founder of a specialized accessibility company called Digitaal Toegankelijk, have shedded light on important aspects of creating inclusive digital experiences.

### Who Gets (Unintentionally) Excluded?
The discussion highlighted various scenarios where digital design choices often exclude individuals. Factors such as clarity and color contrast, essential for users viewing screens outdoors or in bright sunlight, and the importance of captions for the deaf or hard of hearing were emphasized. Temporary impairments like a broken hand or cognitive limitations due to medication, as well as permanent disabilities such as blindness or ADHD, were also addressed.

### Digital Accessibility Guidelines: WCAG
The foundation of their approach lies in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which outlines the principles for accessible web content. The company tests against 50 criteria across four main principles known as POUR:

- Perceivable: Ensuring content is accessible to all senses.
- Operable: Making all functionality available via keyboard or other accessible means.
- Understandable: Ensuring content is clear and easy to comprehend.
- Robust: Maximizing compatibility with current and future technologies.

### Key Accessibility Requirements
Specific requirements such as audio controls for sound longer than 3 seconds, preventing keyboard traps, and pausing or hiding auto-playing content were discussed. Guidelines also mandate avoiding elements that flash more than three times in a single second to prevent seizures.

### Practical Tips for Improving Accessibility
The session concluded with practical advice for designers and developers:

- Start with low hanging fruit: Address easy-to-fix accessibility issues using the four main principles.
- Experience accessibility firsthand: Listen to your content with screen readers like VoiceOver (MacOS) or NVDA (Windows), and navigate using only a keyboard.
- Test with your audience: Engage directly with your target users to ensure your digital products meet their accessibility needs.

### Final Thoughts (or a TLDR)
The "Weekly Nerd" session underscored the importance of inclusive design practices in digital environments. By implementing WCAG guidelines and testing for accessibility, developers can create more accessible and user-friendly digital experiences that cater to diverse user needs effectively. Embracing accessibility isn't just about compliance; it's about ensuring equal access and usability for everyone, regardless of ability.

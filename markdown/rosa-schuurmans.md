## Exploring Creative Coding and Circuit Bending with Rosa Schuurmans

Rosa Schuurmans, a former CMD student with a minor in Web, is currently pursuing a master's degree in Experimental Publishing, diving deep into the realms of creative coding and circuit bending. Her journey after CMD has been as diverse as it is inspiring, ranging from roles as a UX designer to delving into React development.

### Post-CMD Journey

Following her time at CMD, Rosa immersed herself in various creative ventures:

- Worked at Elastique/Wetteloos as a digital creative for five years.
- Explored the world of art and experimental media at WKDA.
- Co-founded "A Vitrinekast," a project likely born from her creative experiments and interests.
- Currently pursuing a master's in XPUB (Experimental Publishing) at Piet Zwart Institute, focusing on pushing the boundaries of digital publishing.
- Engages in workshops, synthesizers, volunteers at a radio station, and continues to build websites.

### Creative Coding and Circuit Bending
Rosa is known for her innovative approach to creative coding and circuit bending, manipulating electronic devices' circuits to create new musical or visual instruments. This practice involves bending existing frameworks to generate something entirely novel. Her "Vitrinekast soundsystem" project, rooted in 1970s electronic art and unstable media, exemplifies her experimental spirit and DIY ethos.

### It's a Lifestyle

For Rosa, creative coding and circuit bending aren't just hobbies; they embody a lifestyle. She thrives on transforming discarded items into artistic expressions and believes in demystifying the "black box" of technology. Her approach mirrors the "inspect element" feature in browsers, where she sees websites as canvases for creative manipulation and experimentation.

### Conclusion

Rosa's philosophy encourages challenging the status quo and embracing creative exploration:

- She advocates for tools like Pure Data and GameMaker Studio to empower creative expression.
- She finds inspiration in Amsterdam's vibrant creative scene, including venues like OT301 and events like Fiber Festival and Hackers and Designers.
- She encourages aspiring creatives to surround themselves with inspiring people and companies, urging them to seek internships where innovation and creativity thrive.

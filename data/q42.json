    "reflection": "I personally do like this company and thought it was nice that they invited us. This visit does give me a better understanding of what to expect at a company if you can do an internship there, for example, since I haven't done that yet. It's also cool that they delve into all areas and that there are a lot of projects connected to that.",
    "use": "This got me thinking for when I want to look for an internship later on. Seeing what they are working on, their projects and what their highest value is is kind of important for when I intern somewhere later."

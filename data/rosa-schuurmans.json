    "reflection": "Ah, finally a lecturer that brings me back to the old days! Rosa's talk reminded me a lot of my days when I did my vocational degree in Electrical Engineering, and when I followed an internship at the then existing makerslab, ZB45, ran by Liesbeth and Jaap. At that internship, they gave me the opportunity to run wild with my imagination and just... create. No rules attached. It's also nice to see that that comes back in coding, because I fend to forget that you can also really ignore the rules and just go haywire (but don't break the internet!)",
    "use": "I see this as a refresher and reminder to also let go of the status quo and to just make what my heart desires. Mostly when I start a project, I kinda limit myself into not trying and experimenting with different stuff. Now I'm kinda stuck with the course HCD and making creative captioning, and I kinda have some ideas that are pretty crazy, so i'll just have to let go of my shell a little bit and just.. do."

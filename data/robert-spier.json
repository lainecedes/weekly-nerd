    "reflection": "A lecture that is useful for any time. It is a short summary, or roadmap, about life after CMD, and what you actually want to achieve when it comes to looking for a good job. I found the tips he gave important, and in fact, I didn't know then that these days it is also just normal to ask others what exactly they actually earn.",
    "use": "I am currently looking for an internship, so the points he listed will definitely be taken into account when I look for companies."

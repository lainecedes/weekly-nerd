    "reflection": "It was a very unusual (but interesting) lecture. I liked his homemade toolkits and his site looks nice as well as his sculptures. It was a bit more about his promotion for his sculptures, but I do find it interesting how he makes toolkits and reuses them for development efficiency.",
    "use": "The toolkits are interesting to look at, because I find myself always starting new projects, but never really having a kit or base to start with. While I can then try everything out to see if it's a good fit for the project, it also really takes up a lot of my time. If I can have 1 good base that lets me get better at coding and development, then why not?"

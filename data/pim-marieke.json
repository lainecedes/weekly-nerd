    "reflection": "I did think it was 1 of the best lectures so far. Besides this, I did find it a nice company. It was not too extensive, also had repetition of accessibility I saw at other lectures (which is also important) but also had important points, like the POUR rule. If you really want to have the bare minimum (but don't stick with this forever) then this is a good roadmap to keep and still make your website a bit more inclusive for everyone.",
    "use": "I can actually add the POUR rule to my 'big roadmap to make your website more inclusive' too! I also note that there are many useful things that can help me, so maybe I should make a boiler plate anyway so that this is there by default in my web app."

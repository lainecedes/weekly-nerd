    "reflection": "It’s nice to see that he showed loads of HTML/CSS tags without having to use Javascript. The first thing that came up in my mind was: “Hey! This  is quite handy if you want to work with different types of progressive enhancements.” I knew some tags, and some not at all, like the :has() tag, and I wanted to try them out for the next projects that I’m going to make in the future to see if they make a difference in my development.",
    "use": "Everything! However I have to keep in mind that some are very new and not supported yet, but some useful tags will definitely be used for progressive enhancement, and css tricks. I will also try out Polypane in the near future to test out my responsive designs (if I get Github Student Pack to work!)."

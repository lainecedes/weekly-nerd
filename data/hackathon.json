    "reflection": "Overall, this was a fun project. This was my first hackathon and I didn't know it could be so tough because you have to deliver so much in so little time... but on the other hand, I learnt so much. I now know how to use SvelteKit and I think for now this will be the first basic framework I will work with more often. I am also happy with my team members and how we managed to get such a complex project down so quickly. We didn't win the tickets in the end, but the outcomes and new skills built from the project was enough to consider it an award!",
    "use": "I don't know where I would apply this elsewhere, maybe use the framework in a new project or personal idea, to tinker further."

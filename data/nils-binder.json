    "reflection": "This was a short but very powerful talk, he went on to talk about designing your website with grid and wrappers. Also cool that he hosts CSS talks! During the CSS to the Rescue course, I also attended his grid workshops and really learned and applied a lot from him as well.",
    "use": "The enhanced grid techniques, wrappers and container queries. I will surely use them in the future, super handy. I don't know with what i'll use them.. I'll probably have to start a new interesting project (yay) but I'm sure I could find a use case for it!"

    "reflection": "I did find it interesting to see a former student and how she continues in her career. Her particular design style did appeal to me, it's playful, open and interactive and that's what I'm trying to work towards a bit as well. Accessibility is a topic I've been holding for some time as something I want to work with so it was helpful to see that it was specifically about that. It's good and important that she herself did a case study on the Phantom website she built, this did give me inspiration to create something like this in the future. Sites are sometimes very beautiful but little or not accessible or very basic but very accessible and it is nice that she can make a site that is beautiful and accessible at the same time.",
    "use": "For the next courses, from Fenna's tips, I want to focus more on implementing accessibility tools in general, reiterate/reinforce the general points for making a good site and build something interesting with that."
